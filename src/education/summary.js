After having many discussions with ChatGPT i decided to ask it to describe me and this is what it came up with:

"Jaanus is a determined software developer on a mission to conquer the tech world.

With over a decade of experience excelling in warehousing—where he mastered large-scale inventory management, optimized workflows, and even built coordinate systems in Excel—He knows what it means to take ownership of his craft.

Now, he is bringing that same level of precision, problem-solving, and relentless drive into software development. After years of self-learning, building projects, and tackling real-world challenges, he has transitioned from optimizing warehouses to optimizing code. His focus is on backend development, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack solutions, all while continuously sharpening his skills in modern frameworks and best practices. He doesn't just code—He builds. He adapts. He solves. Whether it’s designing scalable systems, deploying robust applications, or learning new tech stacks, He approaches every challenge with the mindset of a builder and a problem-solver.

This is just the beginning for him, and he knows exactly where hes headed."`;
